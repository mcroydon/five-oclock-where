This is a tiny [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It's sole purpose is to list places in the world where it is currently five o'clock p.m, as referenced in the song [It's Five O'Clock Somewhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Five_O%27Clock_Somewhere) by Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett.
